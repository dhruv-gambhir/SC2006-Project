## **Application Skeleton**

### Frontend

#### Files that are not documented yet

- `SimpleMap.js`

### Backend

#### Please make documentation and Application Skeleton Code for the backend

&nbsp;

## **Dialogue Map**

### Comments from frontend

- When user reach the home page, they will be redirected to the map page, i.e. there is no home page, but I think can keep the Home Page blob in the Dialogue Map.

- There's also the dietary restrictions options (e.g. vegan, vegetarian, etc.) option, I think that should also be included in the map.

- Some functions that might not be implemented

  - Forgot password (process might be simplified)
  - Follow user / friends function

## **Data Dictionary**

Looks good to me

Might need to change / remove some functional requirements if we are not able to implement all of the functions

&nbsp;

## **System Requirements**

Same as [Functional Requirements](#functional-requirements)

&nbsp;

## **System Architecture**

Looks good to me
